# WebScraping_Bypass_Encryption

**Author**: ANTHONY-OLEVESTER

## Overview

**WebScraping_Bypass_Encryption** is a Python-based toolkit designed to facilitate web scraping tasks, particularly focusing on bypassing encryption and obfuscation mechanisms that hinder data extraction. The project incorporates multithreading, proxy support, and various utilities to enhance the efficiency and reliability of web scraping operations.

## Features

- **Multithreaded Scraping**: Utilize multiple threads to accelerate data extraction processes.
- **Proxy Support**: Integrate proxy servers to circumvent IP-based restrictions and avoid detection.
- **Email Extraction**: Identify and extract email addresses from web content.
- **Dead Link Detection**: Detect and handle broken or dead links during scraping.
- **Data Deduplication**: Ensure uniqueness in the collected data by removing duplicates.
- **Batch Processing**: Process large datasets in batches for improved performance.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ANTHONY-OLEVESTER/WebScraping_Bypass_Encryption.git
   cd WebScraping_Bypass_Encryption
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Install required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

The project comprises several Python scripts, each serving a specific function:

- `main.py`: The primary script to initiate the web scraping process.
- `main-thread.py`: Implements multithreaded scraping for enhanced performance.
- `main-proxy.py`: Incorporates proxy support to bypass IP restrictions.
- `email_List.py`: Extracts email addresses from the scraped data.
- `Deadlink.py`: Identifies and handles dead or broken links.
- `Unique.py`: Removes duplicate entries to ensure data uniqueness.
- `countUnique.py`: Counts the number of unique entries in the dataset.
- `batch.py`: Processes data in batches for large-scale scraping tasks.
- `Company.py`: Possibly extracts company-related information.

### Running the Main Script

To start the scraping process:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Configuration

Before running the scripts, ensure you configure any necessary settings such as:

- **Target URLs**
- **Proxy Settings**
- **Thread Count**
- **Output Paths**
